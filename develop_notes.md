## Inspiration
1. uspex
2. calypso

Study the necessary constraints for modelling, de-similarities, find inspirations from them.

## Consider
1. Consider the reaction as evolution from gene?
2. Get in touch the gene evolution algorithm
3. Reaction product stages as gene evolution, as energy determined? or 'gene' determined
4. Reference to gene evolution algorithms
